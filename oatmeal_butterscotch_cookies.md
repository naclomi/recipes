Oatmeal butterscotch cookies
Adapted from http://allrecipes.com/recipe/soft-oatmeal-cookies/

- 1 cup butter, softened
- 1 cup white sugar
- 1 cup packed brown sugar


- 2 eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract


- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon salt (leave out if butter is salted)
- 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon


- 1 1/2 cups quick-cooking oats
- 1 1/2 cups regular/old-fashioned/classic oats
- 1/3 bag of butterscotch chips


In a medium bowl, cream together butter, white sugar, and brown sugar. Beat in eggs one at a time, then stir in vanilla. Combine flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon; stir into the creamed mixture. Mix in oats (the bigger "old-fashioned" oats give a good texture while the quick-cooking give a more ubiquitous "oaty" flavor) and butterscotch chips. Cover, and chill dough for at least one hour.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. Roll the dough into walnut sized balls, and place 2 inches apart on cookie sheets. Flatten each cookie with a fork or your washed hands.

Bake for 8 to 12 minutes in preheated oven. If split across multiple racks, rotate pans between high and low racks once after 3-4 minutes (once cookies begin to spread). Take cookies out when you can lift one very lightly at an edge and the whole cookie seems to bend upward with it, with the bottom golden brown. The top will still be really soft, but that's okay - it'll set quickly outside of the oven.

Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
