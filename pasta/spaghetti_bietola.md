Spaghetti Bietola

- 2 bunches red chard
- Half bulb garlic
- 14oz white beans, drained
- 14oz _canned_ _cherry_ tomatoes
- A few large splashes balsamic vinegar
- Olive oil
- Salt, to taste
- 1/3 box thick spaghetti

Sautee garlic, coarsely chopped, in olive oil. Add diced chard stems and cook for a bit, then shredded leaves. Add vinegar and some salt, give a stir, put on lid, and cook down a bit. 

Add drained beans and tomatoes, bring to a boil, and then down to a simmer.

Simmer while cooking spaghetti. When al dente, mix into veggies. Serve with shredded parmesan.

Note on cherry tomatoes:
If you can't find canned cherry tomatoes, you can substitute for 14 oz worth of fresh cherry tomatoes that have been microwaved until soft, and then 8 oz of tomato puree (use the empty whitebean can to measure)
