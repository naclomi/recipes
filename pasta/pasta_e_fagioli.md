Pasta e Fagioli

1 onion
3 cloves garlic
Dried sage, to taste
Dried oregano, to taste
1 good handful of baby carrots
3 slices bacon
1 cup vegetable stock
1 14oz can diced tomatoes
1 14oz can italian white beans, w/ liquid

Dice onion, mince garlic, chop carrots into small discs.

Sautee bacon in olive oil until bacon is browned, remove. Add onions and cook until translucent, then add garlic and cook until fragrant. Add carrots and spices, and let everything sautee together on high for a little bit. Add stock, tomatoes, and beans w/ liquid. Stir well, add carrots and crumbled bacon from earlier. Boil on high for a minute or two, then turn it down to high simmer and let it cook for another 10 minutes or until beans are soft. Serve mixed with fusilli pasta.

TODO: 
      * figure out if that splash of "no-chicken" stock makes a difference
      * try adding celery or some herbs or something (one other recipe mentioned fresh sage)
