# Naomi's Big Beautiful Zucchini Pasta

Ingreds:
- 4 good zucchini (good = small but mature)

- 1/2 cup sweet white wine (moscato's a champ here)
- 1/2 lb linguini (rummo 4 ever)
- Garlic powder
- Onion powder

Procedure:

- Preheat oven to 450 F.
- Boil a huge pot of water for pasta.
- Cut zuccs lengthwise into 4 spears, and then spears into 1-inch long chunks

- Mince garlic
- Toss zuccs in olive oil and dust liberally with garlic powder, onion powder and paprika to coat.
- Separately, toss greem breems in olive oil as well. Dust with a pinch of kosher salt.
- Spread zuccs evenly on a pan and roast well until tender and there are little crispies on the pan, tossing them around half way through.
- When the water comes to a raging boil, toss in pasta
- When the zuccs look ready to eat, push them into one half of the pan put green beans on the other half. Roast for ~5 min until green beans begin to soften.
- Drain pasta and reserve 1/3 cup pasta water
- Sautee garlic in olive oil until it begins to turn the lightest shate of gold, then deglaze with pasta water and white wine
