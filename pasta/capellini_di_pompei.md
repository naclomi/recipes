# Capellini di Pompei

Inspired by a huge beautiful tray of pasta I had in Pompei in 2005
The idea here is that because capellini soaks up sauce a LOT more than thicker pastas, we're aiming for a sauce that's both very brothy and very flavorful.

## Ingreds

- 14oz crushed tomatoes (Pomi pull-tab cans are my fave)
- 14oz canned cherry tomatoes (StrianePse brand carries them)
- 1/2 lb capellini pasta
- Half bulb's worth of garlic
- 1 lb brussels sprouts
- 1/2 cup sweet white wine
- 1 tsp brown sugar
- Handful of basil

## Procedure

Brussels:

- Clean and quarter the brussels. Toss them in olive oil, salt, pepper, and chili flakes. Roast them until they're crispy.

Pasta:

- Put a pot of water to boil. Salt it. Cook the capellini. You know.

Sauce:

- Crush garlic in garlic press straight into a liberal amount of olive oil. Sautee until just about to turn brown.

- Glug wine into there. We're looking for enough to initially stop the spatter and take a minute or two to boil off.

- Once thick bubbles form, throw in both cans of tomatoes. Cook on medium high until sauce thickens slightly, but not too much. We're aiming for still slightly soupy.

- Taste. If a little tart, or if you're using a particularly dry white wine, throw in the pinch of brown sugar.

- Add minced basil and thoroughly coat capellini with sauce. Then toss in brussels.

Serve with parm and a candle, muah <3
