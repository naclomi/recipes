Smokey Eggplant Ragu
====
Loosely adapted from https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/veal-parmesan-3646066

- 1 japanese eggplant
- Mesquite or hickory wood chips
- 28 oz canned peeled whole tomatoes
- 9 oz crushed tomatoes (1/3 of a 28oz can, you can freeze the rest for future use)
- 1-2 tbsp tomato paste (to taste)
- 1 white/yellow/sweet/whatever onion
- 4 cloves garlic
- 1/2 cup dry red wine
- oregano, to taste
- salt, to taste
- extra virgin olive oil (of course)

Eggplant prep
----
Slice eggplant diagonally into half-inch thick rounds. Toss in olive oil.
Prepare BBQ grill/smoker with either mesquite or hickory wood chips.
Grill eggplant until golden brown, potentially even a little burnt.
Alternatively, broil eggplant.

Sauce
----
Cover bottom of sauce pan liberally in olive oil.

Coarsely chop onions, add a few dashes of salt, and carmelize over low heat for ~20
minutes while doing the other prep. Once onions are sweating but not yet
carmelized, add a small splash of crushed tomato.

Finely mince garlic. Coarsely chop grilled eggplant. Pour whole tomatoes
(with juice) into a bowl and crush with your hands until well-pulverized.

Once onions are golden brown and charred around the edges, add garlic and
turn up to high heat. Sautee until fragrant.

Deglaze pan with red wine. As wine is boiling, add chopped eggplant and
boil until smelling rising steam no longer burns your nose with boozy smell.

Add bowl of hand-crushed tomatoes, can-crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and
oregano. Cover and bring to a boil for a few minutes. Stir occasionally and
after you feel thick sauce accumulating on the bottom of the pan, reduce to
a high simmer. 

Taste - if too sweet/tomatoey (usually happens when using more
tomato paste or if you accidentally use half a can of crushed tomatoes LIKE
I DO ALL THE TIME UGH), add a splash or two more of the wine. Give yourself
a swig too, you earned it.

Partially cover pan to allow steam to escape and cook, stirring occasionally,
until thick 'n saucey (about 15 minutes).

Hooray! Goes great with a side of escarole and beans, or sauteed green beans.

Eggplantless Alternative
----
You can make this sauce without eggplant or a smoker, it's still great! It
becomes a bit more fruity, and goes swimmingly with roasted brussel sprouts.

Ingredient replacements:
- Skip eggplant and woodchips
- 4 slices Morningstar Farms veggie bacon

Before adding onions, sautee bacon strips until lightly crisp. Remove from pan
and cook with the same oil according to recipe, adding crumbled bacon bits instead
of chopped eggplant at the deglazing step.
