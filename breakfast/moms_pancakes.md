Mom's pancakes
---------------------

Adapted from the Bakewell Cream cookbook

- 1.5  cups flour
- 1.5  tsp  Bakewell Cream
-  .75 tsp  Baking Soda
-  .5  tsp  salt
- 2    tbsp sugar

- 2 eggs
- 1 cup + 2 tbsp milk
- 1 tbsp melted butter

In a large bowl, sift together dry ingredients, making sure there are no lumps.
In a smaller bowl, beat eggs, add milk and butter. Stir into flour mixture - just until mixed.
Pour spoonfuls of batter onto heated greased pan. Cook until top is covered with bubbles. Turn pancakes and brown other side. Makes 10 to 15 pancakes.

Mom's notes:
- If flour is in freezer, warm up in microwave!
- If double recipe, use big bowl!
- Fry in butter
- Use 1/8 tsp salt, instead of 1/2 tsp
- Doubled proportions:
  - 3 cups flour
  - 3 tsp Bakewell Cream
  - 1.5 tsp baking soda
  - 1/4 tsp salt (assuming used 1/8 in single recipe)
  - 4 tbsp sugar (or a little less)
  - 1 cup + 3 tbsp milk
  - 2 tbsp butter
