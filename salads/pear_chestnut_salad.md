# Pear Chestnut Salad
For after the holidays, when you need to use up those fancy gift pears and have left over roasted chestnuts :)

- 2/3 bag of arugula/spinach/lettuce mix
- 1 fancy pear, sliced
- 1/3 cup crumbled roasted chestnuts
- 1/2 cup shredded Beecher's New Woman cheese
- 5 small assorted radishes, mandolined
- Olive oil, to taste
- Lemon juice, to taste

Mix things in a bowl, toss with equal parts olive oil and lemon juice. Good time.

## Notes
- possibly add thinly sliced onion?
