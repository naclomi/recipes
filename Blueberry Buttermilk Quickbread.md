Adapted from: https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-buttermilk-quick-bread-with-10-different-variations-164621



### Ingredients

##### Dry

- 2 cups all-purpose flour (10 ounces)
- ½ cup white sugar (4 ounces)
- 1½ teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon salt

##### Wet

- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 cup buttermilk (8 ounces)
- 1 large egg
- ¼ cup unsalted butter, olive oil, or vegetable oil (2 ounces)

##### Tasty

- 1 to 1½ cups of blueberries (fresh, frozen, or dried reconstituted in bourbon)
- Zest of 1 lemon

##### Finish

- 3 teaspoons brown sugar



### Instructions

1. Heat the oven to 350°F. Grease or spray with nonstick cooking spray a standard 9x5 loaf pan.

2. Whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a medium mixing bowl. Melt the butter, if using. Whisk it in a separate bowl with the buttermilk, vanilla and egg.

3. Pour the liquid ingredients over the dry ingredients. Gently stir and fold the ingredients until all the flour has been incorporated and a shaggy, wet batter is formed. Be careful not to over-mix.

4. Fold in blueberries and lemon zest until just mixed

5. Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and pat it into the corners. Generously sprinkle brown sugar on top of the loaf. 

6. Bake for 45-50 minutes. When finished, the loaf should be domed and golden, and a toothpick inserted into the center should come out clean. Let the loaf cool in the pan for 15 minutes before removing and slicing.

7. Wrap baked loaves tightly in plastic wrap and store at room temperature. Baked loaves can also be wrapped in plastic and aluminum foil and frozen for up to three months.

   

### Notes

- Mealy, bland, out-of-season blueberries actually work better here than ones that are tasty and tart when eaten plain
- If not available, buttermilk can be replaced with a mix of yogurt and milk, or milk and a squeeze of lemon
- This cake is gr8
