Preheat oven to 325 F. Toss oats with brown sugar and oil, then spread evenly on a parchment-lined small cookie sheet and toast until fragrant and golden brown, about 20 minutes.

Meanwhile, put yogurt in a bowl and top with coarsely chop unpeeled apple. Grind cardamom pods, also coarsely, with a mortar and pestle and sprinkle on top.

When ready, add granola followed by honey (honey can be added pre-granola as well, depending on preferred consistency).
