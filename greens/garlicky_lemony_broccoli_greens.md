ingredients:

- a big bunch of greens, enough to fill a medium sized frying pan
  - either broccolini with thicker stems trimmed off
  - italian heirloom broccoli of the variety that looks a lot like broccoli rabe, keep the leaves and stems <3
- half a bulb of garlic
- extra version olive oil
- lemon juice
- salt and pepper, to taste

doing the thing:

- fill half of a medium sized frying pan with water, cover and bring to a boil
- throw the greens in there and steam with the lid on for 2 minutes
- meanwhile, mince garlic
- drain the greens and rinse thoroughly in cold water
- dry the pan and add enough olive oil to cover about half of its bottom
- fry the minced garlic until it's fragrant and just on the edge of turning golden
- add the greens to the pan, turn heat down to low-medium, and toss
- mix in salt and pepper to taste
- cover all the greens in lemon juice, giving a hearty splash of juice for each patch of greens
- simmer for a minute, until a fair bit of the liquid steams off

good things to do with it:

- mix in with crispy italian sausage medallions, pasta, and ricotta to make a nice light pasta dish
- make a meatball sub:
  - fry/bake/cook some meatballs (i like trader joe's meatless meatballs, when i can find them)
  - melt provolone on a hoagie roll in the microwave
  - put meatballs on top of cheese
  - ladle a hearty amount of eggplant ragu on top
    - (the recipe for that is also in this repo)
    - sauce can be made ahead of time and ladled cold straight from the fridge, it provides a nice temperature contrast
  - top with a big bunch of garlicky broccoli greens
  - sprinkle shredded/shaved parmesan on top
