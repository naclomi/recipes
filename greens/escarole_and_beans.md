Escarole and Whitebeans

- 2 large heads of Escarole, washed and shredded
- 28 oz canned cannelini, white, or butter beans, undrained
- 4 large cloves garlic, minced
- 3 strips veggie bacon
- oliveeee oilllllll

Partially cover the bottom of a large saucepan with olive oil (a few tbsp) and toss in escarole. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Cook covered on medium, stirring occasionally, until tender but still a little crunchy (5-10 minutes).

Meanwhile, in a separate frying pan, cover the bottom in olive oil and saute veggie bacon strips on medium-high until golden brown. Remove bacon and add garlic. Saute garlic until golden brown, and then add the beans and their liquid. Simmer beans until they're creamy and begin to lose a little definition (5-10 minutes).

One both greens and beans are thoroughly cooked, mix the beans into the greens, along with crumbled bacon, and simmer for another 5 minutes or so.
