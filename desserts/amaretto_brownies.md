Ingredients

16 tbs sticks unsalted butter
8 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped
1 1/4 cups flour
1 teas baking powder
Pinch salt
4 large eggs
2 cups sugar
2 tbs amaretto
unsweetened dried cherries
Preparation

Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and line a 9x9 baking pan with parchment paper. Grease the paper as well.

In a saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter and chocolate. Whisk gently until smooth. Remove from heat and let sit for 5 minutes.

Meanwhile, whisk the flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl.

In a large bowl, whisk the eggs and sugar until pale yellow and smooth. Add the amaretto and mix in. Carefully add the chocolate, whisking the entire time.

Add the flour to the chocolate mix and stir until combined.

Spoon the batter into your prepared pan, sprinkle the top with dired cherries, and bake for 40 to 45 minutes, until brownies are done.

Allow to cool in pan before removing and slicing into servings.
