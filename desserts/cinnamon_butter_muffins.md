Adapted from http://www.shutterbean.com/2013/baked-cinnamon-sugar-doughnuts/

## Ingredients
* 1 cup all-purpose flour
* 3/4 cup sugar
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
* 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1 extra-large egg, lightly beaten
* 1/2 cup buttermilk
* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
* 1 teaspoons vanilla extract

For the topping:
* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
* 1/2 cup sugar
* 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

## Recipe

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Use a bakerâ€™s spray to coat a muffin tin.
Sift together the flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt in a mixing bowl.
Whisk together the egg, milk, melted butter and vanilla extract in a medium bowl or liquid measuring cup. Pour into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined.

Fill the wells of the muffin tin a bit more than three-quarters full with the batter. Bake for 15-17 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean and the muffins are in general puffed and lightly browned. Let them cool (in the pan) for 5 minutes, then gently remove them with a knife.

Whisk together the sugar and cinnamon in a medium bowl. Melt the 2 tablespoons of butter in a bowl.
Dip the top of each muffin in the butter, and then into the cinnamon-sugar mixture to coat the top.

Serve warm.
