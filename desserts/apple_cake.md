# Apple Cakeeeee
adapted from http://www.myrecipes.com/recipe/cinnamon-apple-cake

## Ingreds

- 1.75 cups white sugar, divided into 1.5 cups and .25 cups
- .5 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 6 ounces block-style cream cheese, softened (about 3/4 cup)
- 2 large eggs
- 1.5 cups all-purpose flour
- 1.5 teaspoons baking powder
- 1.25 teaspoons salt
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 3 cups of Rome or Fuji apples, chopped into cubes about the size of a game die (about 2 large apples)
- Cooking spray

## Preparation
Preheat oven to 350°.

Beat 1.5 cups sugar, butter, vanilla, and cream cheese at medium speed of a mixer until well-blended (about 4 minutes). Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Combine flour, baking powder, and salt. Add flour mixture to creamed mixture, beating at low speed until blended.

Combine .25 cups sugar and cinnamon. Combine 2 tablespoons cinnamon mixture and apple in a bowl, and stir apple mixture into batter. Pour batter into an 8-inch springform pan coated with cooking spray, and sprinkle with remaining cinnamon mixture.

Bake at 350° for 1 hour and 15 minutes or until the cake pulls away from the sides of the pan. Cool the cake completely on a wire rack, and cut using a serrated knife.

Note: You can also make this cake in a 9-inch square cake pan or a 9-inch springform pan; just reduce the cooking time by 5 minutes.
