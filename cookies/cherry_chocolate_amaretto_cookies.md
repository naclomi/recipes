Adapted from http://www.geniuskitchen.com/recipe/chewy-chocolate-cookies-5049

## Ingredients: 
- 1/2 cup + 2 tbsp butter
- 1 cup white sugar
- 1 egg
- 2 tbsp DiSaronno
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/4 cup + 2 tbsp cocoa powder
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1/2 cup dark chocolate chunks
- 1/2 cup dried montmorency cherries

## Instructions:

1. Heat oven to 350Â° F.
2. In large mixer bowl with a hearty spoon, or using a stand mixer, cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy.
3. Add eggs and vanilla, beat well.
4. Combine flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt. Gradually blend into creamed mixture. Stir in cherries and chocolate chips.
5. Drop by teaspoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheet. 
6. Bake 8-9 minutes. Do not overbake; cookies will be soft. They will puff while baking and flatten while cooling.
7. Let cool until you can easily move them from the cookie sheet to a plate. Consume while hot and gooey :) .
