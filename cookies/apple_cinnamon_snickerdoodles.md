# Apple Cinnamon Snickerdoodles

Adapted from http://www.gimmesomeoven.com/appledoodles-apple-snickerdoodles/

## Ingredients

* 8 Tbsp. (1 stick) unsalted butter
* 2/3 cup brown sugar
* 2/3 cup white, granulated sugar
* 2 eggs
* 2 cup all-purpose flour
* 2 Tbsp. cornstarch
* 1 tsp. baking soda
* 1/2 tsp. salt
* 1/8 tsp. nutmeg
* 2 small apples / 1 large apple, peeled, cored and diced small
* 1/3 cup sugar
* 3 Tbsp. ground cinnamon

## Directions

Preheat oven to 350°F. 

Cream both of the sugars into the butter. Stirring vigorously, add the egg to the mixture and beat until the batter looks uniform.

In a separate bowl, stir together the flour, cornstarch, baking soda, salt and nutmeg. Then slowly fold into the batter until just combined. Then add in diced apples, and gently fold them by hand into the batter until well-distributed.

If dough is too soft, place covered in the freezer for 5 minutes

Form balls of dough and plop them in cinnamon sugar. Toss cinnamon sugar on top and then swirl around. On a greased or parchment lined cookie sheet, place the dough balls 3 inches apart. Use the greased base of a glass to press and flatten the dough slightly and sprinkle an extra pinch of cinnamon sugar on the flattened surface.

Set the first timer for 7 minutes. Turn the pan around and set a second timer for 7 minutes. If you are using a greased pan they might be done at this point, or need another minute. If you’re using parchment, cookies will take 2-3 minutes more. You are looking for golden edges and a blonde middle.

Cool on a baking sheet and enjoy. Snickerdoodles will keep in an airtight container, at room temperature for 3 days, but they are best eaten the day they’re made.
