Salted Tahini Chocolate Chip Cookies
===========================================
Adapted from http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018055-salted-tahini-chocolate-chip-cookies

- 4 ounces/113 grams unsalted butter at room temperature
- ½ cup/120 milliliters tahini, well stirred
- 1 cup/200 grams granulated sugar
- 1 large egg
- 1 egg yolk
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons/150 grams all-purpose flour, or matzo cake meal (See tip)
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 ¾ cups/230 grams chocolate chips or chunks, bittersweet or semisweet
- Flaky salt, like fleur de sel or Maldon

Cream butter, tahini and sugar until light and fluffy. Add egg, egg yolk and vanilla and continue mixing.
Sift flour, baking soda, baking powder and kosher salt into a large bowl and mix with a fork. Add flour mixture to butter mixture at low speed until just combined. Use a rubber spatula to fold in chocolate chips. Dough will be soft, not stiff. Refrigerate at least 12 hours; this ensures tender cookies.
When ready to bake, heat oven to 325 degrees and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or nonstick baking mat. Use a large ice cream scoop or spoon to form dough into 12 to 18 balls.  
Place the cookies on the baking sheet at least 3 inches apart to allow them to spread. Bake 13 to 16 minutes until just golden brown around the edges but still pale in the middle to make thick, soft cookies. As cookies come out of the oven, sprinkle sparsely with salt. Let cool at least 20 minutes on a rack.
