Ingredients:
- 12 Tbs. (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, browned (see note below) & cooled
- 2 1/2 cups (11 1/4 ounces by weight) flour
- 1 1/2 tsp. baking soda
- 1/2 tsp. salt
- 1/4 tsp. cinnamon
- 1/4 tsp. nutmeg
- 1/4 tsp. allspice
- 1/2 cup (3.5 ounces by weight) dark brown sugar
- 1/2 cup (3.5 ounces by weight) light brown sugar
- 1/2 cup (3.5 ounces by weight) granulated sugar
- 1 egg
- 1 egg yolk
- 3 tsp. vanilla
- 2 Tbs. Bourbon

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.  Line two large baking sheets with a Silpat liner or parchment paper.  To brown the butter: place butter pieces in a small sauce pan over medium heat.  When the butter begins to foam, stir with a wire whisk and continue to whisk constantly.  The color will begin to change and you'll see some brown flakes on the bottom of the pan.  Continue to stir until the butter has a nutty fragrance and is golden brown.  Remove from the heat and stir until the foam subsides.  The whole process will take 8-10 minutes.  Be patient!

In a medium bowl, mix the flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice together until blended.  Set aside.

In the bowl of a stand mixer, add all of the sugars, along with the cooled brown butter and, using a paddle attachment, mix until well-blended.  It won't be creamy like a normal cookie batter.  Add the egg, egg yolk and vanilla and mix until combined.  With the mixer on low sweet, add the bourbon and mix until it is distributed.

Slowly add the dry ingredients and mix just until incorporated.  Using a 2 3/4-ounce ice cream scoop, scoop the dough onto the prepared baking sheets.  Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes until the cookies are just done on the edges.

Cool for about 5 minutes on the cookie sheet before transferring to a wire rack.
